# Mustagram â€” Instagram Clone (Laravel 12 + MongoDB)

ðŸ‘‰ **Live demo:** [mustagram.laravel.cloud](https://mustagram.laravel.cloud)

I built Mustagram as a focused, production-style Instagram clone to practice full-stack development with **Laravel 12** and **TailwindCss** , **MongoDB** and **Cloudinary**. The app demonstrates practical architecture choices: a reusable image upload component, Cloudinary integration (optional), and a scalable follow system implemented as a dedicated collection. This repo collects the code, configuration notes, and the lessons I learned while building the app.

```

#### installing dependencies

```
composer install
npm install
npm run dev

```
DB_CONNECTION=mongodb
DB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.example.mongodb.net/instagram_clone
```

##### Cloudinary :

```
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://<api_key>:<api_secret>@<cloud_name>
